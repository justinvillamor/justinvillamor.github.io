        <p> Hello there! As you may know by now, my name is Justin and I'm currently pursuing a
            B.S. in Bioengineering along with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)
            at <u>UC Berkeley. </u> </p>
        <p> My current career path was fueled by my innate desire to learn how the various intricate parts of objects
            came together to give the object its function. Whether it be <u>childhood toys</u> or vastly more complex
            <u>gene-editing technology</u>, I've always loved to learn how things worked. </p>
        <p> On a more personal note, I was born and raised in a city called Torrance in Southern California.
            <u>Going to the beaches</u>, <u>hiking numerous trails</u>, and <u>sampling the diverse cuisine</u> the
            area to offer were all regular tasks for me as a SoCal native. I'm also a huge sports fan with
            some surprising favorite teams (Minnesota Vikings, Miami Heat) and have played basketball for
            <u>nearly my entire life.</u> When I want to relax, however, you can easily find me playing the newest
            <u>video games</u> or cooking myself a <u>new dish.</u> </p>
        <p> Anyways, I'm glad that you've come and reached my site! Feel free to look around and/or <u>connect<u/> with me! </p>
