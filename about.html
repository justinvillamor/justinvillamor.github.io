        <p> Hello there! As you may know by now, my name is Justin and I'm currently pursuing a
            B.S. in Bioengineering along with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)
            at <u class="berk">UC Berkeley. </u> </p>
        <p> My current career path was fueled by my innate desire to learn how the various intricate parts of objects
            came together to give it its function. Whether it be childhood toys or vastly more complex
            gene-editing technology, I've always loved to learn how things worked. </p>
        <p> On a more personal note, I was born and raised in a city called Torrance in Southern California.
            <u class="beach">Going to the beaches</u>, <u class="hike">hiking numerous trails</u>, and <u class="food">sampling the diverse cuisine</u> the
            area to offer were all regular tasks for me as a SoCal native. I'm also a huge sports fan with
            some surprising favorite teams (Minnesota Vikings, Miami Heat) and have played basketball for
            <u class="young">nearly my entire life.</u> When I want to relax, however, you can easily find me playing the newest
            <u class="game">video games</u> or cooking myself a <u class="dish"> new dish.</u> </p>
        <p> Anyways, I'm glad that you've come and reached my site! Feel free to look around and <u class="con">
            <a href="connect.html">connect<u/> with me! </p>
